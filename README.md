In this modern technologically advanced world, Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a very important topic in every language due to its various trendy applications. But SA in Bangla language is still in a dearth level. This work focuses on examining different feature extraction techniques and examining different learning algorithms on Bangla SA using a new comprehensive dataset of 203,493 comments collected from various microblogging sites. The proposed dataset approximately holds the Zipf's law, covering 32.84% function words with a vocabulary growth rate of 0.053, tagged both on 15 and 3 sentiment categories. In this study, we considered the basic sentiment categories of angry, boring, disgust, enthusiasm, fear, fun, happy, hate, love, relief, sad, sexual, surprise, worry and neutral, further mapped to these categories to higher sentiment categories of positive, negative or neutral. Our empirical study considered 21 different feature extraction methods including Bag of Words (BOW), N-gram, TF-IDF, TF-IDF-ICF, Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe, Bangla-BERT etc with CBOW and Skipgram mechanisms, among them the proposed novel method (Bangla-BERT+Skipgram) outperforms all other techniques. Among the applied classifiers, Random Forest algorithm from Machine Learning (ML) and CNN-BiLSTM algorithm from Deep Learning (DL) domains surpasses the others. Friedman test has been performed on the obtained results to observe the statistical significance which demonstrates that the results of the statistical test are significant for both the cases. As an application of the system, our empirical study considered the food review analysis from Bangla texts and applied the already built models of the proposed sentiment analysis system, where Random Forest and CNN-BiLSTM models outperformed other models.
